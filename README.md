# mspacman

A genetic programming library centered around creating agents for Ms. Pac-Man. This is the product of my master thesis at the University of Bergen.


The whole thing is in disarray and might not even work for you. A new and better GP library is in the works, but who knows when I will be able to finish that now that I am no longer activly working on my master thesis.

## Usage

You will need a copy of the Ms. Pac-Man binaries that are compatible with CottAGE.
